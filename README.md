# Covid-19-analysis
The "Covid-19-Analysis" repository is a comprehensive project that focuses on analyzing the spread of COVID-19 in India. It involves various components, including creating an interactive and dynamic dashboard using Tableau, conducting data exploration to discover insights, and handling missing values and outliers using Python libraries. Let's break down these components in more detail:

1. Project Overview:

The project aims to provide a deep analysis of the COVID-19 pandemic's progression globally.
It utilizes data visualization, data exploration, and data preprocessing techniques to extract meaningful insights from the COVID-19 dataset.
2. Data Sources:

The project relies on COVID-19 datasets from reputable sources which is the World Health Organization (WHO).
The dataset include information about the number of cases, deaths, recoveries, testing, and demographic information for various regions and countries.
3. Interactive Dashboard (Tableau):

You are using Tableau to create an interactive and dynamic dashboard called "covid analysis.twbs."
This dashboard should present key COVID-19 metrics, trends, and comparisons between different countries or regions.
Features of the Tableau dashboard may include time series charts, maps, filters, and user interactivity for exploring the data.
4. Data Exploration (Python):

Data exploration is a crucial step in understanding the dataset and identifying patterns and insights.
Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib/Seaborn are used to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA).
EDA involves summary statistics, data visualization (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots), and identifying correlations and trends in the COVID-19 data.
5. Handling Missing Values:

It's common for datasets to have missing values, and these must be addressed to maintain data integrity.
Techniques like imputation (e.g., filling missing values with mean, median, or mode) or dropping rows/columns with missing values are employed to handle missing data.
6. Outlier Detection and Treatment:

Outliers can skew analysis and visualizations, so identifying and handling them is important.
Python libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or specialized outlier detection methods are used to detect and possibly remove outliers.
